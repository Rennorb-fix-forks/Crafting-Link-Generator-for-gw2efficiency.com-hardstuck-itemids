#Crafting-Link-Generator-for-gw2efficiency.com#

This Script can be used in Tampermonkey to generate a button that opens up the gw2efficiency crafting calculator with the items listed in the builds on snowcrow.com, metabattle.com and (in the future) hardstuck.gg.

To use this script just add it to your tampermonkey userscripts.

ATTENTION:
Due to the unique build codes on hardstuck.gg this does not work on hardstuck.gg as of now.
